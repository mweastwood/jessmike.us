    <h2>Planning Details</h2>
    <p>
      We're getting married and we're so excited to share our special day with
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Planning our wedding has been complicated by the current pandemic, and
      it's honestly difficult to predict what restrictions may be in place on
      the date of our wedding. We want to keep everyone up-to-date with our
      plans and contingencies. Important updates will be shared on this site
      and over email as the event draws closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the explicit caveat that all of these details are subject to
      change, we have summarized our current plans below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	      We don't want to delay the start of our life together, so we will
	      be getting married on <span class="highlight">July 17</span>. The
	      exact size of the ceremony and specific plan will adapt with local
	      restrictions, which are impossible to forecast at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
	      A live <span class="highlight">video stream</span> will be available
	      to help you be a part of our wedding no matter where you happen to
	      be. We will share instructions for how to watch the live stream
	      closer to the date of the event.
      </li>
      <li>
        If local restrictions in California remain approximately as they are
        now, but travel restrictions between Canada and the U.S. persist:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We will get married as planned with a total capacity proportional
            to what is allowed by local regulations. A video feed will be
            available for all guests that are unable to travel.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will plan a make-up family reunion in <span
            class="highlight">Montreal</span> for a later date.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	      In the event of severe restrictions on the number of people able to
	      attend:
        <ol>
          <li>
            We will get married in a small ceremony with only immediate
            family in attendance. A video feed will be available for all
            other guests.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will attempt to reschedule the reception to a later date for
            which we hope you'll be able to join us.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We hope that you are all staying safe! We miss you so much and hope to
      see you soon. If you have specific questions for the Bride and Groom,
      please feel free to reach out to one of us directly or our email at <a

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>As told by Jessica</h3>
    <p>
      Be prepared, Michael loves my choppy piecemealed stories, I am actually
      not all that good about telling stories AT ALL. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We met online, and I was intrigued as soon as I saw <em>astronomy</em>
      on Michael’s profile hoping that he would show me the stars! But little
      did I know about Radio astronomy then, so I was amazed at his patience
      when trying to explain all the different subjects of astronomy during
      our study dates. It took a year for him to actually show me the stars
      LOL.
    </p>
    <p>
      These past three years has been a wild adventure with loads of support
      and growth, praying and dreaming together, and of course tons of inside
      jokes. I love that he puts up with my bajillion ideas and helps me bring
      them into reality. Even though Michael could survive on burritos, mac and
      cheese, and pizza alone, I am glad he adventures with me to try different
      cuisines and appeals to the food-lover in me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael’s love for his family &amp; friends, his kindness, and his golden
      heart always give me the warm and fuzzies, and I knew when he was playing
      with our own nieces and nephews, that he would fit perfectly into the
      family. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael’s devotedness and love of the Catholic church encouraged me to
      continue my own journey, and we had faith that even though we were going
      to be long distance, it was worth a shot, and I am glad we took the leap
      and never looked back. All the plane flights out of Burbank and San Jose
      and long drives were worth it! Fun fact: we compared rosaries on our
      first date! Talk about divine intervention ;) 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am beyond delighted and feel extremely blessed to be joining the
      Eastwood/Dermarkar family and can’t wait for both of our families to come
      together as we celebrate this next step in our lives! We would love all
      your love, support and guidance throughout our marriage. Please pray for
      us! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s party!!! (Once COVID decides to stop being a party-pooper) 
    </p>

    <h3>As told by Michael</h3>
    <p>
      Jessica and I met online in the Summer of 2018, and I remember being
      taken by Jessica's compassion and selflessness. On our second date, I
      took Jessica to the Independent Shakespeare Company's showing of A
      Midsummer Night's dream. Free Shakespeare in Griffith Park was always a
      staple of my summers in LA, and it was always a good opportunity for a
      picnic and good company, and I was excited to share this experience with
      Jessica. Jessica took the opportunity to share our picnic with a single
      mother nearby, whom I hadn't even noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a few months later, I defended my thesis and moved north to the Bay
      Area to begin a new job and a long distance relationship. We got
      intimately familiar with BUR, SJC, and the 5, as we regularly traveled
      back and forth. For all the challenges that long distance relationships
      offer, there is nothing quite like the feeling when I would catch my
      first glimpse of Jessica after weeks of separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard to identify a single moment at which I knew I wanted to marry
      her, but in some sense I think I always knew. So, I <em>finally</em>
      proposed to Jessica on December 27, 2019 after flying across the country
      to surprise her. We retraced many of our first dates before I popped the
      question at the LA Arboretum. I ultimately can't keep a secret if my life
      depended on it (and Jessica reads me like a book), so she wasn't nearly
      as surprised as I had planned, but luckily that didn't change her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning, we've worked to put family and faith at the center of
      our relationship. I have been so blessed to be welcomed into Jessica's
      wonderful family from the moment I first joined her extended family at
      church (the same church at which we are now getting married). We've also
      been lucky enough to share many adventures in our story so far, and below
      we've included some of our favorite pictures from our time together.
      Coronavirus-permitting, we hope you can share in the joy of us starting
      our life together too.
